		<h4>CS1021 - Introduction to Computing I&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Lecturer 2017/18</span></h4><br/>
		<p>Introduction to Computing I is taken by all first year Computer Science along with 'Computer Science and Business' and 'Computer Science and Language' students. This module provides students with an introduction to the basic structure, properties and operation of microprocessor systems. By developing and executing simple assembly language programs, the module aims to give an understanding of how programs execute on a microprocessor system.</p>
		
		<h4>CS1022 - Introduction to Computing II&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Lecturer 2015/16</span></h4><br/>
		<p>Introduction to Computing II is taken by all first year Computer Science. The module continues directly from CS1021 (which is a prerequisite) and examines the structure and behaviour of microprocessor systems in greater depth. In particular, this module will introduce students to the implementation of subroutines and simple data structures, handling exceptions and interrupts and basic I/O.</p>

		<h4>2E3 - Computer Engineering II  &nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Teaching Assistant 2014/15</span></h4><br/>
		<p>Computer Science II is a Senior Freshman Engineering course that builds on 1E3 Computer Science. The course ensures that all students have a grounding in the use of standard algorithms and data structures for problem-solving and in the design of software solutions using object-oriented methodologies. Standard concepts in algorithms and data structures, such as stacks, queues, sorting, searching and dynamic data structures are introduced taught through C++.</p>

		<h4>1E3 - Computer Engineering I  &nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Teaching Assistant 2014/15 & 2013/2014</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Demonstrator 2012/13</span></h4><br/>
		<p>This module aims to equip students with the skills to design and develop simple imperative programs. It provides a solid grounding in algorithm design and programming techniques, in preparation for later courses that require programming.</p>

		<h4>2E10 - Engineering Design IV  &nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="byline">Demonstrator 2013/14 & 2012/13 </span></h4><br/>
		<p>The 2E10 Engineering Design IV module introduces the challenge of electronic systems design. The project is an example of ‘hardware and software co-design’ and the scale of the task is such that it requires teamwork and a co-ordinated effort. Each group has access to the basic shell of a vehicle that includes the motor assemblies, battery holders and sensors. The completed system should comprise of a computer controlled autonomous vehicle with motor driven wheels and position sensors. The motors and the position sensors should operate under control from a programmable microcontroller and the vehicle should communicate with a base station using a wireless standard module.</p>
